# Giftastic
## Introduction
Giftastic is an introduction to API calls and dynamically modifying the html page through javascript.

## How it works
This page has a set of buttons pre-determined with values of Disney Channel Shows, when the button is click `giphy api` calls 10 giphs with that value and a `rating` of up to pg and `prepends()` them in a still state to the page. Onclick will make the gif come to life and go back to still state.

## How to use
Giftastic is an app to call gifs from the `giphy api` and display the image and rating to the page in a still state. There are two methods to use the app:
1. Click on the existing buttons to call gifs from the disney shows associated
   - This will call 10 images and rating from the `giphy api`
   - Click on any gif and watch it come to life! 
   - Click on the same gif to watch it go back to a still state
2. Type a name of your disired gif you would like to see in the 'Add a new Disney Channel Show' input field and click 'Submit'
   - This will dynamically add the button to the page with the value of the name you put in the input field
   - Click on the button you just created and the `giphy api` will prepend 10 new images to the page
   - Click to bring image to life and click again for still state
