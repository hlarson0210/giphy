# Giftastic
## Introduction
Giftastic is an introduction to API calls and dynamically modifying the html page through javascript.

## How to use
Giftastic is an app to call gifs from the `giphy api` and display the image and rating to the page in a still state. There are two methods to use the app:
1 Click on the existing buttons to load gifs from the disney shows associated
   - This will call 10 images and rating from the `giphy api` and `prepend` them to the page
   - Click on any gif and watch it come to life! 
   - Click on the same gif to watch it go back to a still state
2 Type a name of your disired gif you would like to see in the 'Add a new Disney Channel Show' input field and click 'Submit'
   - This will dynamically add the button to the page with the value of the name you put in the input field
   - Click on the button you just created and the `giphy api` will prepend 10 new images to the page
   - Click to bring image to life and click again for still state
